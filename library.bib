	abstract     = {In situ FTIR spectroscopy has been used to investigate the adsorption of acetonitrile at room temperature onto zirconia activated at various temperatures (423, 723 and 873 K), attention being focussed on the sample pretreated at 423 K. Two acetamide monoanions (CH3CONH-), called alpha and beta species, were spectroscopically evidenced with main bands, respectively, at 1169, 1432, 1590, 3320 cm(-1) and at 1196, 1471, 1557, 3340 cm(-1). The use of O-18- Or D-labelled compounds gave poor results as far as the vibrational mode description was concerned, except for the delta(NH) mode. However, the H --> D substitution was very useful for determining mechanisms. It was proposed that the beta-type acetamide species results from H2O displacement from the surface and CH3CN adsorption in acidic Lewis sites, followed by a hydroxylation of this latter species by H2O readsorption. The formation of the alpha-type acetamide species was thought to be due to a direct interaction of acetonitrile with basic OH groups. Upon heating at a temperature higher than 373 K and in the presence of water vapour, acetamide species were hydrolysed into acetate species.},

	abstract     = {The nu CN band (nu C N) is a sensitive probe of the state of molecules with nitrile groups. Hence, physicochemical properties of acetonitrile and its derivatives have been frequently investigated by means of vibrational (IR and Raman) spectroscopy. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with high-level quantum mechanical calculations offers deeper physical insight into the structure of liquid nitriles not available from the fundamental region. This results from unique information provided by the overtones of nu CN. Here, we report an application of anharmonic vibrational calculations coupled with IR, NIR, and Raman spectroscopy for investigation of the structure of CH3CN, CD3CN, and CCl3CN in the liquid phase. The computational part was based on generalized vibrational second-order perturbation theory (GVPT2) applied on the density function theory (B3LYP, M06-2X, and B2PLYP) level to monomers as well as linear and cyclic dimers. The obtained data were refined by counterpoise-corrected MP2 calculations to mimic the aggregation in the liquid state. Our results evidence that the intensity variations between the fundamental, first and second overtones of the nu CN band depend on the symmetry of aggregated species. The symmetry of the cyclic dimers in liquid nitriles was elucidated from the relative intensity of the 2 nu CN band. This work advances our understanding of the vibrational spectra of acetonitrile and its derivatives by providing detailed band assignment of IR, NIR, and Raman spectra. For the first time, we reported the position of the first and second overtones of the nitrile group.},

A fully covariant second-quantized extension of the formalism is outlined. We give also a general derivation of intensities for all non-linear processes using Racah algebra in Liouville space. We describe diagrammatic representations of the perturbative solutions of the equations suitable for all laser spectroscopy techniques. Simple topological rules characterize Doppler-free processes. The diagrams and their associated diagrammatic rules are illustrated by their applications to the computation of Ramsey fringes in the case of single photon, Doppler-free two-photon and saturation spectroscopies. Finally we show how light-shifts can be calculated by this method and find, as expected, that the shifts for Ramsey fringes are reduced by the ratio of the laser beam radius to the zone separation when compared to the shifts for the single zone signal.},

Current approaches to designing porous liquids rely on sterically bulky solvent molecules or surface ligands and, thus, are not amenable to many important solvents, including water2–4. Here we report a generalizable thermodynamic strategy to preserve permanent microporosity and impart high gas solubilities to liquid water. Specifically, we show how the external and internal surface chemistry of microporous zeolite and metal–organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals can be tailored to promote the formation of stable dispersions in water while maintaining dry networks of micropores that are accessible to gas molecules. As a result of their permanent microporosity, these aqueous fluids can concentrate gases, including oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), to much higher densities than are found in typical aqueous environments. When these fluids are oxygenated, record-high capacities of O2 can be delivered to hypoxic red blood cells, highlighting one potential application of this new class of microporous liquids for physiological gas transport.},

At 94 K, vacuum-annealed SWNTs showed no detectable ammonia uptake. However, the ammonia adsorption was found to be sensitive to the functionalities and defects on the nanotube surfaces. NH3 adsorption was detected on HNO3-treated nanotubes, characterized by significant functionalities and defects, prior to vacuum annealing. NH3 desorbed from those nanotubes above 140 K, indicating a weak adsorbate-nanotube interaction (similar to 30 kJ/mol). Exposure of annealed samples to ambient air, which possibly regenerated functionalities and defects on nanotube surfaces, restored partially the ammonia uptake capacity. No ammonia adsorption on SWNTs was observed by infrared spectroscopy at room temperature with up to 80 Torr dosing pressure. This work suggests the influence of functionalities and/or defect densities on the sensitivity of SWNT chemical gas sensors. Our theoretical studies on NH3 adsorption on pristine and defective tubes, as well as oxidized tubes, corroborate these findings.},

The fate of the functional groups under heating and the physically trapped CO2 generated from the decomposition of these functional groups are investigated. Vacuum heating to similar to 1300 K removes most of the oxygen-containing functionalities in the purified samples. The similarities in the infrared spectra of the Rice Tubes after a 1400 K treatment with spectra for the as-received and air/HCl treated HiPco nanotubes suggests the observation of intrinsic SWNT IR bands. Vacuum heating of nitric acid treated HiPco samples leads to the formation of a new feature, tentatively assigned to cyclic anhydride groups, in the 1850 cm(-1) region. The cyclic anhydride groups decompose and ultimately disappear after thermal annealing to 600 K. Above 700 K, the quantity of CO2 trapped in HNO3 treated HiPco SWNTs decreases and trapped CO2 is completely released from the nanotubes after 1100 K even though oxygen-containing functionalities are still present on the sample. The Rice Tubes made by the laser ablation technique retain the physically trapped CO2 even after heating to 1400 K.},

The outermost core orbitals—corresponding to the ns2np6 configuration for the three rows here—are not replaced by the ECP but are treated on an equal footing with the nd, (n+1)s and (n+1)p valence orbitals. These ECP’s have been derived for use in molecular calculations where these outer core orbitals need to be treated explicitly rather than to be replaced by an ECP. The ECP’s for the forth and fifth rows also incorporate the mass–velocity and Darwin relativistic effects into the potentials. Analytic fits to the potentials are presented for use in multicenter integral evaluation. Gaussian orbital valence basis sets are developed for the (3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p), (4s, 4p, 4d, 5s, 5p), and (5s, 5p, 5d, 6s, 6p) ortibals of the three respective rows.},

Three different linker molecules, i.e. terephthalic acid (H2BDC), 2-chloroterephthalic acid (H2BDC-Cl) and 2,6-naphtalenedicarboxylic acid (H2NDC) that have previously been used for the synthesis of Ce-UiO-66 which contains hexanuclear Ce-O clusters as the inorganic building unit (IBU), were employed. Under solvothermal reaction conditions (140 degrees C) with acetonitrile as the solvent the compounds Ce-MIL-140-BDC, -BDC-Cl and -NDC, with the general composition [CeO(linker)] were obtained as microcrystalline products. For all three MOFs an extended purification process had to be carried out. The MOFs were fully characterized and the structure of Ce-MIL-140-BDC was refined against PXRD data using the Rietveld method. In contrast to Zr-MIL-140-BDC a symmetry reduction to the space group P (1) over bar is observed. The MIL-140 structure type is built up by infinite CeO7 polyhedra that are interconnected by dicarboxylate ions to generate 1D pores. For Ce-MIL-140-BDC the highest specific surface area of a(sBET) = 222 m(2) g(-1) is observed and the MOF is thermally stable up to 370 degrees C. This new synthetic route to Ce(IV)-MOFs avoids the formation of the previously extremely dominant hexanuclear IBU, and paves the way for higher IBU diversity in Ce(IV)-MOFs.},

Despite the powerful spectroscopic information reveled by these methods, development of TSF and DOVE spectroscopies has been hindered by difficult data acquisition and spectral artifacts produced by nonlinear effects, such as interference induced by phase mismatch. As a result of these experimental restrictions, the majority of TSF and DOVE work has been performed in analytical “standard” molecules that are of minimal interest to the scientific community at large. In this dissertation, we report on progress made to increase the usability of these methods and optimize visualization of complex data. We demonstrate a method to mitigate spectral artifacts associated with phase mismatch, thereby allowing for flexibility in experimental design and data that is easier to interpret. We also incorporate a new laser system design that allows for more rapid and “turnkey” acquisition of CMDS spectra. We apply these enhanced TSF methods to the study of cyanocobalamin, which is a large molecule whose quantum structure is of great interest to the fields of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry. The TSF experiments performed in this work identify complex coupling relationships within the molecule.},

Results obtained from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, pyrrole, chloroform, acetonitrile, alcohols, thiols, boric acid trimethyl ether, ammonia and pyridine are critically reviewed. It is concluded that no probe can be universally used. Pyrrole in the case of alkaline zeolites, CO2 for weakly basic metal oxides and for basic OH groups and CO for the characterization of highly basic structural defects on metal oxides activated at high temperature appear quite suitable probes. When other methods are used (TPD, microcalorimetry, volumetry, etc.) IR spectroscopy is a complementary method necessary for the knowledge of the type of sites involved; in particular, data obtained from CO2 and SO2 adsorption have to be carefully used since both probes can lead on highly basic metal oxides to polydentate (bulk) species which do not result from their adsorption but from their reaction with the given oxide. Ammonia and pyridine, generally used as probes for the measure of the acidity of catalysts, also adsorb on basic oxides through a dissociative chemisorption.},

In most pure t-ZrO2 specimens, the absence of terminal and bi-bridged surface hydroxyls hinders completely the base-catalyzed CD3CN reactions which yield on other oxides either acetamide-like species or carbanionic surface species. In the case of sulfated t-ZrO2, even if some terminal hydroxyls are present, the mentioned surface reactions are hindered by the presence of acidic (sulfate) functionalities. On pure t-ZrO2, the predominant adsorbed species are represented by CD3CN molecules Lewis-coordinated to coordinatively unsaturated (cus) surface cationic sites. These sites are made available either by surface dehydration or by ligand-displacement of surface-coordinated (undissociated) water molecules. Lewis-coordinated CD3CN species dominate also on sulfated t-ZrO2, and the relevant adsorbing sites are made available both through the two mechanisms active on pure t-ZrO2 and through an additional ligand-displacement effect concerning polydentate surface sulfates. On sulfated t-ZrO2 systems, there exists an abundant protonic (Bronsted) acidity, a fraction of which can be revealed by CD3CN adsorption through the formation of a relatively strong H-bonded species. The CN vibrational mode for these H-bonded species is distinct from that of weakly adsorbed H-bonded and/or physisorbed species.},

	abstract     = {The ambient temperature adsorption/desorption of acetonitrile (ACN), in its deuterated form, was used for the surface characterisation of several ZrO(2)-based systems. On pure m-ZrO(2), ACN uptake originates four types of chemisorptive interaction: sigma-coordination to coordinatively unsaturated (cus) surface cations (Lewis acid sites), formation of weak H-bonding with bridging surface hydroxyls, and two surface reactions. The latter are a partial hydrolytic reaction, leading to (at least) three acetamide-like surface anionic species, and the extraction by basic surface sites of one H (D) atom, leading to monomeric and/or polymeric surface carbanionic species. The proportion among the four types of interaction is mainly determined by the samples activation conditions. Comparison of m-ZrO(2) data with some preliminary data of ACN adsorption on t-ZrO(2) suggest that the two surface reactions of ACN depend on the presence at the ZrO(2) surface of terminal (single-coordinated) hydroxyl groups, whose IR vibrational frequency is at similar to 3775 cm(-1). This hypothesis has been confirmed by ACN adsorption/desorption on some surface-modified m-ZrO(2) systems: (i) m-ZrO(2) pre-treated with chloroform, which selectively interacts with terminal hydroxyls; (ii) m-ZrO(2) pre-treated with a weak acid (CO(2)), which interacts weakly with surface basic sites; (iii) m-ZrO(2) with the surface partly covered by strong acid groups (sulfates). The latter system (sulfated m-ZrO(2)) presents, when highly hydrated, a medium-weak Bronsted acidity, otherwise absent on all other m-ZrO(2) systems considered.},

We consider ordinary absorption (single photon processes), two photon processes (absorption and Raman spectra) and saturation effects in multiphoton processes (absorption and Raman spectra in a strong radiation field). Various approximation schemes such as the cluster and the perturbative expansion, semiclassical and stochastic methods and the static and the impact limits are discussed. Special attention is given to the factorization approximation which appears in the present formalism in a natural way, and allows us to use the enormous progress made in the studies of single photon line shapes to construct useful approximations for multiphoton processes. The inclusion of nonimpact phenomena is therefore straightforward within the present approach. Some numerical calculations are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the methods developed in this article.},

	abstract     = {The interaction of CH3CN on Pt(111) was studied with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and work function change (DELTAphi). Submonolayer, monolayer and multilayer states are distinguished. Measurements at submonolayer coverages are consistent with an orientation of adsorbed acetonitrile which is parallel to the surface. No infrared absorption attributable to the CN bond at around 2200 cm-1 or 1600 cm-1 could be detected by IRRAS, consistent with an eta2(C,N) state for the monolayer, as suggested by Sexton and Avery. In addition, IRRAS data showed that there was a red shift of the C-H stretches of the methyl group with the absence of methyl bends. Agostic bonding involving the beta-hydrogen is proposed to explain this observation. We denote this state as eta2*(C,N) to emphasize the involvement of the beta-hydrogen in chemisorption. For monolayer coverage, IR activity for all bands present in the submonolayer spectrum decreased in intensity. The magnitude of this effect seems too large to be attributed solely to screening by neighbouring dipoles. The multilayer showed IR bands in good agreement with those in the vapour phase spectrum. When the crystal was annealed to remove the multilayer and part of the monolayer, IRRAS detected two species with the CN dipole having a component normal to the surface. These are the terminal and bridge bonded acetonitrile adsorbed via the nitrogen atom. Implications for chemical vapour deposition using cyanide containing precursors are discussed.},

The formation of H-bonded CDCN adducts of different strength with silanols and with strong Brønsted sites is described. It is shown that an integrated spectroscopic study gives complementary information on the observed H-bond adducts. While the presence of isosbestic points in IR spectra allows a clear demonstration of the existence of equilibria between species, H NMR spectra give information about dynamic adsorbate exchange phenomena.},

Two heating schedules are considered: (a) a linear variation of sample temperature with time (T = T0+ßt), and (b) a reciprocal temperature variation (1T=1T0−αt). The activation energy of desorption is estimated from the temperature (Tp) at which the desorption rate is a maximum (for first-order reactions) and from the change of Tp with surface coverage (for second-order reactions). The order of the reaction is determined from the shape of the desorption rate versus time curve, or the variation of Tp with coverage. Applications of these methods to experiments on chemisorption and the desorption of ionically trapped gases are discussed. The effect of finite pumping speed in the system is analysed and the necessary corrections derived.},

	abstract     = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and specifically the UiO family of MOFs have been extensively studied for the adsorption and degradation of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and their simulants. We present a combined experimental and computational study of the adsorption of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a CWA adsorption simulant, in functionalized UiO-67. We have used density functional theory (DFT) to design functionalized MOFs having a range of binding energies for DMMP. We have selected three different functionalized MOFs for experimental synthesis and characterization from a total of eight studied with DFT. These three MOFs were identified as having the weakest, intermediate, and strongest binding energies for DMMP of the set, as predicted by our DFT calculations. We find that the order of predicted binding energies agrees with data from temperature-programmed desorption experiments. Moreover, the values of the binding energies are also in good agreement. This serves as a proof of concept that ab initio calculations can guide experiments in designing MOFs that exhibit a higher affinity for CWAs and their simulants. One surprising outcome of this work is that reactions between DMMP and the three functionalized UiO-67 MOFs were not observed under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions for the exposure of DMMP of up to 9000 L. This lack of reactivity is attributed to the low levels of defects in the materials used.},

	abstract     = {The highly excited vibrational states of polyatomic molecules are investigated using canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory, implemented in a superoperator framework. This approach is used to transform a vibrational Hamiltonian to a new representation which has a form ideally suited to the study of the dynamics of interest. The key advantage is that the solution to the full problem is obtained in the new representation using significantly smaller basis sets than are needed to obtain the solutions in the original representation. The transformations are applied to the Hamiltonian operator itself, not the Hamiltonian matrix; this superoperator approach obviates the need for large basis sets. The tedious and complex algebra, that is required to perform these transformations, is readily implemented with FORTRAN codes. Combining these two features has enabled the investigations of vibrational dynamics in energy regimes and densities of states, unattainable by standard methods. These methods are applied to two model problems and to the study of the highly excited overtones of CHD3 with up to five quanta of excitation in the CH bond.},

In this MOF, the Pt centers are coordinated to Cl and the N atoms of the BPDC unit, giving a local environment similar to that found in a series of Pt-organic complexes with catalytic activity toward C-H bond cleavage of alkanes. This new material is a heterogeneous counterpart to the corresponding metal-organic complex. The structure, determined by single-crystal XRD data, is the repetition of three covalently bonded layers. These layers form a block, which is stacking as an (a)(b)(c) sequence along the crystallographic b-axis. Each layer contains the Pt-organic unit, while Y atoms represent the connection between adjacent layers. No covalent connection is present between layer (a) of a block and layer (c) of an adjacent block. EXAFS (BM29 at the ESRF) analysis supports the XRD data. As this MOF crystallizes under hydrothermal conditions, water acts both as solvent and as a direct ligand of Y. Accessibility to the metal centers is demonstrated by reversible water desorption/readsorption, as determined by TPA/TPD, FTIR, UV-vis, EXAFS, and XANES. Importantly, the results show that the as-synthesized material will not suffer a permanent loss in porosity upon solvent removal. In addition to water, methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile can also access the internal void of the dehydrated phase.},

The results are compared to those obtained on gamma-Al(2)O(3). No coordination of carbon monoxide is observed on B(2)O(3)-SiO(2) even at low temperatures, whereas strongly coordinated CO species are formed on gamma-Al(2)O(3) under such conditions. Coordinated pyridine and acetonitrile show important infrared frequency shifts on both metal oxides, indicating strong charge transfer from the probe molecules to the surface Lewis acid centers. However, the thermal stability of coordinated species is much lower on B(2)O(3)-SiO(2) than on gamma-Al(2)O(3), which suggests that there is no direct correlation between charge transfer and adsorption energy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the interaction of these probe molecules with simple models representing Al(3+) and B(3+) Lewis acid sites adequately reproduce experimental observations. The main difference between Al(3+) and B(3+) results from the higher energy required to convert boron from a trigonal planar conformation to a tetrahedral conformation upon adsorption of the probe molecule. Despite strong charge transfer, this leads to a weaker adsorption of pyridine and acetonitrile on B(3+) as compared to Al(3+) Lewis acid sites. Carbon monoxide is not basic enough to compensate for the energy required for the conformational change of the B(3+) Lewis acid center.},

Solid acetonitrile films can be prepared by vapor deposition in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber. To prevent sublimation of the film, temperatures are often kept below 150 K. While the LT phase is thermodynamically favored at these low temperatures, such preparation usually results in the formation of the metastable HT polymorph. In this work we use reflection adsorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments to investigate the effects of the deposition temperature and underlying substrate on the morphology of acetonitrile films prepared with molecular beam deposition. We obtained the elusive LT phase when dosing at 120 K on a graphene substrate and on a crystalline decane layer. Dosing acetonitrile on other surfaces produced the HT phase, as did annealing of amorphous films. We used TPD experiments to determine the Gibbs energy difference between the HT and the LT phases. Our Delta G values agree with extrapolation of equilibrium calorimetry data. We also observed that acetonitrile films were amorphous when dosed at temperatures <= 60 K and porous for temperatures <= 50 K.},

We used reflection adsorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) to characterize the orientation of the monolayer on Pt(111). Acetonitrile molecules have been shown to adopt a bridging structure where the C N bond breaks to form two single bonds to underlying platinum atoms. When T-deposition >= 120 K, our RAIRS spectra were consistent with this bridging configuration. However, when T-deposition was lowered to 60 K, molecules retained the C N bond and adopted a vertical orientation with the nitrogen closest to the platinum. On graphene, the TPD experiments show that both the monolayer and multilayer desorb with zero-order kinetics. Our RAIRS spectra suggest that the monolayer consists of acetonitrile molecules oriented with their molecular axes parallel to the graphene substrate. This orientation did not change when T(deposition)( )was varied from 60 to 120 K. Our results provide a more complete picture of how acetonitrile molecules interact with Pt(111) and with graphene surfaces.},

For comparison, a gamma-Al2O3 sample having a surface area of 290 m(2) g(-1) was also studied. On partially hydroxylated gamma-Ga2O3, the main O-H stretching bands were found at 3693 (sharp) and at 36603630 cm(-1) (broad), and the material proved (by adsorbed dimethylpyridine) to have a weak Bronsted acidity. Surface Lewis acidity of gamma-Ga2O3 was revealed (mainly) by adsorbed pyridine, which gave the characteristic IR absorption bands of Lewis-type adducts at 1612, 1579, 1488, and 1449 cm(-1) (values noted under an equilibrium pressure of 1 Torr at room temperature); the corresponding Lewis acid centers (coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions) were found to be weaker, although more abundant, than those present on the surface of gamma-Al2O3 (unsaturated Al3+ ions). Another significant difference between gamma-Ga2O3 and gamma-Al2O3 is the smaller thermal stability of pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine Lewis adducts formed on the gallium oxide. The surface basicity of gamma-Ga2O3 was studied by using carbon dioxide and deuterated acetonitrile as IR probe molecules. Adsorbed CO2 gave carbonate and hydrogen-carbonate surface species similar to those formed by gamma-Al2O3. Adsorbed acetonitrile gave rise to acetamide species, which revealed the basic character of surface O2- ions. These acetamide species were found to be more abundant on gamma-Ga2O3 than on gamma-Al2O3.},

Titanium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) MIL-125-NH2(Ti) can photocatalyze, under visible light and at room temperature, the selective aerobic oxidation of benzylamine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine. We investigated the reaction mechanism using catalytic tests, ex situ infrared spectroscopy, and density functional calculations. In the dark, the presence of MIL-125-NH2(Ti) alone does not improve the reaction yield with respect to a blank experiment. This poor catalytic performance in the dark is associated with the absence of polarizing species on the MOF surface, as confirmed by acetonitrile adsorption. Excitation with different spectral regions evidenced the determinant role of the 450 < lambda < 385 nm range for catalyst photoactivation. The calculations show that the last step of the reaction would have an energy barrier of 206 kJ mol(-1) in anhydrous conditions, while it decreases to 88 kJ mol(-1) only if the mechanism is mediated by two water molecules.},

It is important to understand the diffusion of CWAs, their reaction products, and environmental molecules through MOFs to utilize these materials for protection against CWA threats. As a first step toward this goal, we study adsorption and diffusion of acetone in pristine UiO-66. We have chosen to study UiO-66 because it has been demonstrated to be effective for destruction of CWAs and simulants; we use acetone because it is a prototypical polar organic molecule small enough to be expected to diffuse fairly rapidly through nondefective UiO-66. We specifically examine the impact of framework flexibility and hydrogen bonding between acetone and the OH groups on the nodes of the framework on the diffusivity of acetone. We find that inclusion of flexibility is essential for meaningful predictions of diffusion of acetone. We have identified the dynamics of the three linkers making up the triangular window between adjacent pores as the critical factor in controlling diffusion of acetone. We demonstrate from experiments and first-principles calculations that acetone readily hydrogen bonds to UiO-66 framework OH groups. We have modified the classical potential for UiO-66 to accurately model the framework-acetone hydrogen bonds, which are not accounted for in many MOF potentials. We find that hydrogen bonding decreases the diffusivity by about 1 order of magnitude at low loading and about a factor of 3 at high loading. Thus, proper accounting of hydrogen bonding and framework flexibility are both critical for obtaining physically realistic values of diffusivities for acetone and similar-sized polar molecules in UiO-66.},

	abstract     = {The spectra of C1 molecules are confounding in that each of the fundamental vibrational modes transform as the same irreducible representation (A) and hence each band consists of a seemingly random distribution of a-, b-, and c-type transitions. This is in contrast to higher symmetry molecules for which band types are readily deduced by simple symmetry rules. Herein, we present a method to simulate the convoluted rotational contours in the gas-phase spectra of C1 molecules by combining existing ab initio calculations with Colin Western’s pgopher rotational contour program. Specifically, ab initio calculations in the NWChem suite of programs were employed to predict the components of the dipole moment derivatives along the principal axes of the moments of inertia. This information was then input into pgopher to model the fundamental band contours as a sum of a-, b-, and c-type transitions. This method was applied to simulate the rotational contour spectra of a series of representative C1 molecules which were then compared against both ab initio stick spectra and experimentally measured broadband IR spectra from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory infrared gas-phase database. In addition to providing further insight beyond what is revealed in a typical stick spectrum, the simulated contours showed good agreement with the measured spectra.},

	abstract     = {In addition to their well-known redox character, the acidbase property is another interesting aspect of ceria-based catalysts. Herein, the effect of surface structure on the acidbase property of ceria was studied in detail by utilizing ceria nanocrystals with different morphologies (cubes, octahedra, and rods) that exhibit crystallographically well-defined surface facets. The nature, type, strength, and amount of acid and base sites on these ceria nanoshapes were investigated via in situ IR spectroscopy combined with various probe molecules. Pyridine adsorption shows the presence of Lewis acid sites (Ce cations) on the ceria nanoshapes. These Lewis acid sites are relatively weak and similar in strength among the three nanoshapes according to the probing by both pyridine and acetonitrile. Two types of basic sites, hydroxyl groups and surface lattice oxygen are present on the ceria nanoshapes, as probed by CO2 adsorption. CO2 and chloroform adsorption indicate that the strength and amount of the Lewis base sites are shape dependent: rods > cubes > octahedra. The weak and strong surface dependence of the acid and base sites, respectively, are a result of interplay between the surface structure dependent coordination unsaturation status of the Ce cations and O anions and the amount of defect sites on the three ceria nanoshapes. Furthermore, it was found that the nature of the acidbase sites of ceria can be impacted by impurities, such as Na and P residues that result from their use as structure-directing reagent in the hydrothermal synthesis of the ceria nanocrystals. This observation calls for precaution in interpreting the catalytic behavior of nanoshaped ceria where trace impurities may be present.},

	abstract = {Floquet state spectroscopy is an optical analogue of multiple quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (MQC-NMR). Tunable ultrafast excitation pulses resonantly excite multiple states in a sample to form the Floquet state. The Floquet state emits multiple coherent beams at frequencies and in directions that conserve energy and momenta. The different output beams differ in the time ordering and coherences created by the excitation beams. They correspond to the different methodologies in the NMR family. Isolating a specific beam and monitoring the output intensity as a function of excitation frequencies creates multidimensional spectra containing cross-peaks between coupled states. The frequency range of the multidimensional spectra is limited by phase matching constraints. This paper presents a new, to the best of our knowledge, active phase matching strategy that increases the versatility of multidimensional Floquet state spectroscopy through both longer sample path lengths and larger spectral ranges.},
